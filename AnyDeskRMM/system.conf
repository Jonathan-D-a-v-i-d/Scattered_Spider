# =======================
# SECURITY RESEARCH NOTE
# This annotated system.conf demonstrates how AnyDesk can be abused
# when configured for "malicious RMM" behavior (e.g. Scattered Spider).
# These comments are for red-team education ONLY — do not deploy outside
# of an isolated lab. Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK is included inline.

[General]
ad.anynet.id=<YOUR-ANYDESK-ID>          # Unique machine ID used for inbound connection
ad.anynet.alias=<CUSTOM-ALIAS>          # Optional human-readable alias

[Security]
ad.security.unattended_access=true      # DANGER: Enables connection without user consent (T1219 – Remote Access Software)
ad.security.unattended_password=<HASHED-PASSWORD> 
                                        # Pre-seeded password hash; acts as a backdoor credential
                                        # If attacker knows this, they bypass local user entirely

ad.security.allow_file_transfer=true    # Allows attacker to exfiltrate/stage tools (T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer)
ad.security.allow_clipboard=true        # Enables clipboard sync, potential data/credential theft (T1115 – Clipboard Data)
ad.security.allow_system_information=true 
                                        # Built-in recon: attacker can query host details (T1082 – System Info Discovery)
ad.security.allow_remote_reboot=true    # Lets attacker reboot to apply persistence (T1569.002 – Service Execution)
ad.security.allow_uac_interaction=true  # Critical: Remote approval of UAC prompts → PrivEsc (T1548.002 – UAC Bypass)

[UI]
ad.ui.show_accept_window=false          # Suppresses connection prompt → user has no awareness (T1564.003 – Hidden Window)

# =======================
# DEFENSIVE TAKEAWAYS
# • Monitor for edits to C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk\system.conf
# • Alert on AnyDesk service installs where not sanctioned
# • Restrict outbound RMM connections via network controls
# • Use allowlisting to block unauthorized RMM binaries
