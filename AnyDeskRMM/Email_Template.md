Hi [User Name],

Thanks for contacting IT support regarding your computer issue. To help resolve this quickly, I need to remotely access your computer to diagnose and fix the problem.

## What You Need to Do

I've attached our **IT Remote Support Tool** that will allow me to securely connect to your computer. This is much faster than trying to troubleshoot over the phone!

### Quick Setup (takes 2 minutes):

1. **Download** the attached `IT_AnyDesk_Support.zip` file (see attachment below)
2. **Extract/unzip** it to your Downloads folder  
3. **Right-click** on `Deploy_AnyDesk_IT.bat` and select **"Run as administrator"**
4. Click **"Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
5. **Write down the AnyDesk ID** that appears (example: 123 456 789)
6. **Reply to this email** with your AnyDesk ID

### Example of what you'll see:
```
AnyDesk ID: 987 654 321
Password: ITSupport2024!
```

## What Happens Next

Once you send me your AnyDesk ID, I'll:
- Connect to your computer remotely
- Diagnose and fix the issue
- Explain what was wrong and how it was resolved
- Disconnect when finished

## Security & Privacy

âœ… **Safe & Secure**: This is official IT-approved software  
âœ… **Your Control**: I can only connect when you share the ID  
âœ… **Temporary**: You can uninstall after we're done  
âœ… **Supervised**: You can watch everything I do on your screen

## Need Help Installing?

If you have trouble with the installation:
- Make sure to **right-click** and choose "Run as administrator"
- Check that antivirus isn't blocking it
- Call me at [Your Phone] and I'll walk you through it

## Alternative Options

If you prefer not to install remote software:
- We can schedule an in-person visit (longer wait time)
- We can try phone-based troubleshooting (less effective)

Thanks for your patience, and I look forward to getting your issue resolved quickly!

Best regards,
